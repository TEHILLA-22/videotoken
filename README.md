# Video Token

Video Token is a decentralized application (dApp) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that allows users to create, showcase, and trade video tokens—unique digital assets backed by video content—on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by meme coins, Video Token brings a new dimension to the Solana ecosystem by enabling video-based tokens to be minted, collected, and traded just like popular meme coins.

## Features

- 🎬 **Create Video Tokens:** Mint your own video-backed tokens and add them to the marketplace.
- 🔄 **Trade Video Tokens:** Buy, sell, and swap video tokens with other users on the Solana network.
- 📈 **Market Stats:** View trending tokens, market cap, likes/dislikes, and other social stats.
- 🔗 **Solana Integration:** Secure wallet connection and fast transactions powered by Solana.
- 🖼️ **IPFS Video Storage:** Videos are stored on decentralized storage (IPFS) for reliability and censorship resistance.
- 💬 **Social Links:** Showcase your token’s community with Discord, Twitter, and Telegram links.
